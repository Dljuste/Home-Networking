# What I Tested & What I Learned

## Packet Capture
I captured DNS, TCP, and HTTPS traffic to see how different packets look.  
I learned how to follow connections and read basic fields.

## VPN & Tor Traffic
I turned on VPN and Tor on the router and saw how the traffic changed:
- packets were encrypted
- I couldn't read the contents anymore
- my IP address changed in the traffic flows

## Router & Switch Basics
I learned how a router gives out IP addresses (DHCP) and how basic routing works.  
I also learned about switch features like:
- port mirroring  
- VLAN menus  
- bandwidth controls  

Even though I couldn’t use full VLANs with only one device, I understand how they help separate networks.

## Overall Skills Learned
- How to capture and read packets  
- How to use traffic monitoring tools  
- How routers handle traffic  
- How encryption changes what you can see  
- How switches manage ports
